# RPi-Pico-SD-Card-Module

This repository contains example code for basic SD card file operations using C and the FatFs library.

## Introduction

This code demonstrates how to read and write files on an SD card using simple functions. It's meant to be a starting point for projects requiring basic SD card interactions.

## Prerequisites

- Pico C/C++ SDK
- FatFs library

## Usage
1. Set up the Pico C/C++ SDK and include the necessary libraries.
2. Adjust the hw_config.c file to match your hardware setup and requirements.
4. Build and flash the code to your microcontroller.

## File descriptions
- sd_card.h: Header file containing function declarations and necessary includes.
- data_logger.h: Header file for your data-logging related functions.
- main.c: Example implementation of SD card reading and writing functions.
